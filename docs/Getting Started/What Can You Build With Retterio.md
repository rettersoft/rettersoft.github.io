# What Can You Build With Retter.io - Rio?

You can think of Rio as an Operating System running on a Cloud Provider. In this analogy, underlying cloud provider can be thought of like a regular personal computer. (Rio currently only supports AWS as underlying infra.)

Rio is a developer platform abstracting underlying cloud resources. E-commerce, loyalty, online wallets, logistics cloud apps can be easily built using Rio. In these use cases you can increase development speed up to 10x. We have lots of open source example projects you can check out.

Currently Rio is not suitable for everything. For instance we currently don't recommend writing backends for multiplayer games with realtime features.
