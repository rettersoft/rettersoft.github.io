# Project List

Programming with Rio can be also done with [Rio Developer Console](https://c.retter.io/).
In our developer console, we can see our registered projects, see their dashborad, edit their content and much more.

When we login to our developer console we are welcomed with the projects we are in.

In this page we can create new projects, login to our existing ones, and see their status.
