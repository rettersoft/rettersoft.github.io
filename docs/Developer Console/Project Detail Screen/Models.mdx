# Models

Models are mentioned in the [Concepts Model](/docs/Concepts/Models/) in detail. In this page,
we are going to look at how to create and how to use our models in `Developer Console`.

## Creating Models

In your project's panel navigate to `Models` at the left. For creating a new model, click `Create Model` in the upcoming page
than define and name the model. That's all we have created a model!.

> Example of a model
>```JSON title=exampleModel
{
  "properties": {
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The person's last name."
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The person's first name."
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0,
      "description": "Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero."
    }
  },
  "type": "object"
}
```

## Using Models

For using Models, navigate to the `Classes` panel and find the class you want to use your model on and open its `template.yml` file.
Than in the methods, search for the method you want to add your model. You can use your model as
`inputModel` or `outputModel`. Decide what do you want to use your model as than add your model name.

> Like Below.
```yml title=ProjectName/Classes/Test/template.yml
preAuthorizer: index.preAuthorizer
init: index.init
getState: index.getState
methods:
  - method: sayHello # The method we have added our model to
    tag: test
    sync: true
    inputModel: SayHelloInput # Our model added as a input model
    steps:
      - id: default
        handler: index.sayHello
```

That's it you can make use of your model now.
