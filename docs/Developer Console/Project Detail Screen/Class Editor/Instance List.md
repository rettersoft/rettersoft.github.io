# Instance List

This list can be seen by clicking the `Instances` next to the `Test` button. 
`Instance List` allows us the jump back in the previous created `Instances`.

## Usage

After we click on `Instances` this pop-up greets us.
![InstanceList](/img/InstanceList.png)

In this page we can see all of the instances previously created if not deleted.
And we can click on them so work with previously created `payload` and `state`.
That way we don' t have to fill these again and save our precious time.
