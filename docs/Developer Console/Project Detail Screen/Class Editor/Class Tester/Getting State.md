## States in Testing

Methods in our classes may write on states. And controling states before and after beeing overriden by methods is a practical way for debugging.

## How to Get State?

Open the panel in the left in the test view and click on `State`. After that you have a page looking like this:

After that you can `Ã²ptionally` fill the identity, UserId. After that you are ready to get the state by clicking `get`button.
