# Getting a new Instance

Instances are used for testing the methods in our classes.

To create a new instance, press `test button` in the class page you want to test.

## Creating a new Instance

Giving a new instances a payload is optional. If the method we want to call requires a payload,
add them here. 

>We can create new instances randomly by just pressing `Get Instance`.

:::note
Creating a new instances with the names we want is also avalible. While testing you might want to
have more organized enviroment. So having instance names that makes sense can be helpful. 

To name instances, just before creating a new instance fill the Instance ID.
