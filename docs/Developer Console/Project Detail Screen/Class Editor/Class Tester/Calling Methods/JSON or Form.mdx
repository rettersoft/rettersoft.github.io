# JSON or Form

Methods we have wrote may need some variables from outside. We could always provide them with JSON
but using `models` is much more convenient. Because of models allow us to use `Forms` which are easier
to fill and harder to make mistake doing so.

## Filling the `Request`'s

It is easier to understand this concept with a basic example with one method and one model.

>We have a method which has `userValidation Model` as its `inputModel`and writes the profile attributes to its own profile.
>Finally writes that profile to it's response.

```typescript title="Classes/User"
export async function setOfficeProfile(data: Data): Promise<StepResponse> {

  let {phoneNumber, mail, firstName, lastName} = data.request.body;

  data.response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: {
      phoneNumber,
      mail,
      firstName,
      lastName
    }
  };
  return data;
}
```

>Also we have the mentioned `userValidationModel` which has a format for the profile.
```JSON title="userValidation"
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "mail": { // optional
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "phoneNumber": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "firstName",
    "lastName",
    "phoneNumber"
  ]
}
```

### Filling the `Request` with JSON

Let's fill the `request`:

```JSON title="Request"
{
  "phoneNumber": "exPhoneNumber",
  "firstName": "exFirstName",
  "mail": "ex@mail.com", // optional
  "lastName": "exLastName"
}
```
>#### Result:
>![requestResponseJSONFormat](/img/requestResponseJSONFormat.png)
>:::note
If you try to make a request without optional variables (mail in this case) there won' t be any warnings.
It would be like they do not exist.

### Filling the `Request` with Form

Let's fill the `request`:

![requestFormFormat](/img/requestFormFormat.png)
:::note
After you fill the `Form` check the `Body`. You will see that JSON format has been filled.
This feature will also be applied when you fill the body with JSON. Form will be filled with your
variables and with their values.
