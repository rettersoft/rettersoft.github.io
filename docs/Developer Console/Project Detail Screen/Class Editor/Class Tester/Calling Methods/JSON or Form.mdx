# JSON or Form

Methods we have wrote may need some variables from outside. We could always provide them with JSON
but using `models` is much more convenient. Because of models allow us to use `Forms` which are easier
to fill and harder to make mistake doing so.

## Filling the `Request`'s

It is easier to understand this concept with a basic example with one method and one model.

>We have a method which has `userValidation Model` as its `inputModel`and writes the profile attributes to its own profile.
>Finally writes that profile to it's response.

```typescript title="Classes/User"
export async function setOfficeProfile(data: Data): Promise<StepResponse> {
  
  let profile = {phoneNumber: "", mail: "", firstName: "", lastName: ""}

  profile.phoneNumber     = data.request.body.profile.phoneNumber
  profile.mail            = data.request.body.profile.mail
  profile.firstName       = data.request.body.profile.firstName
  profile.lastName        = data.request.body.profile.lastName

  data.response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: {profile}
  };
  return data;
}
```

>Also we have the mentioned `userValidationModel` which has a format for the profile.
```JSON title="userValidation"
{
  "properties": {
    "phoneNumber": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "mail": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "firstName",
    "lastName",
    "phoneNumber"
  ]
}
```

### Filling the `Request` with JSON

Let's fill the `request`:

```JSON title="Request"
{
  "profile": {
    "phoneNumber": "",
    "firstName": "",
    "mail": "",
    "lastName" ""
  }
}
```
