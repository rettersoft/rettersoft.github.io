# GET / POST

There are two types of requests: `Get` and `Post`. Technically they are same.
But principally if we are trying to write some values to some variables we use `Post`.
Also in reverse, if we are trying to read some values from some variables we use `Get`.

:::warning
  Although we said that `Get` and `Post` technically are the same, while using `Get` you can not use the [Forms](/docs/Developer%20Console/Project%20Detail%20Screen/Class%20Editor/Class%20Tester/Calling%20Methods/JSON%20or%20Form) from which are provided from
  [Models](/docs/Developer%20Console/Project%20Detail%20Screen/Models).
