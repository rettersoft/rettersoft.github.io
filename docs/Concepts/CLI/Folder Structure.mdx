# Folder Structure

When your CLI setup is complete you have basic, working project. Structure of this project may seem complicated.
Don' Worry! We will go over everthing what is important to us.

When complete you should have a folder structure looking like this:

![FolderStructure](/img/Untouched_Folder_Structure.png)

## Classes

As you know, Rio is an object-oriented cloud provider. This means we can create number of classes.

## Adding a New Class

For creating a new class, just create a new folder with the class name you want in the `classes` folder.

:::caution
  Numbers are not allowed in class names.

> Adding a new class named `order`:
![FolderStructure](/img/class_folder_structure.png)

As you can see we have additionally 4 files in the class. Let's have a look at them.

### index.ts
Our main logic goes here. We import our models, dependencies here.

For example a `Hello world` looks like this in `index.ts`.

``` ts title="classes/order/index.ts
import RDK, { Data, InitResponse, Response, StepResponse } from "@retter/rdk";

const rdk = new RDK();

export async function authorizer(data: Data): Promise<Response> {
    return { statusCode: 200 };
}

export async function init(data: Data): Promise<Data> {
    data.state.public = {
        message: "Hello World"
    }
    return data
}

export async function getState(data: Data): Promise<Response> {
    return { statusCode: 200, body: data.state };
}

export async function sayHello(data: Data): Promise<Data> {
    data.response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: { message: data.state.public.message },
    };
    return data;
}
```

### package.json

This determines: which class we are in, which `dependencies` we are going to use, and which version we are working with.

A small example of this file:

```json title="classes/order/package.json"
{
  "name": "order",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@retter/rdk": "1.1.1"
  }
}
```

###  rio.ts
We don' t have to add rio.ts to our classes. But this file gives us more functionality.
Such as, using the ecosystem's models and classes, determining the input or output of a method etc.
Its a big `helper` to our projects.

> To add rio.ts, run: 
```shell title:terminal
  > rio generate
```

### template.yml
With this file we determine how and which methods are going to be used.

```yml title:classes/order.template.yml
init: index.init
getState: index.getState
methods:
  - method: sayHello
    tag: order
    invocationType: IMMEDIATE
    handler: index.sayHello
```

## Overall Project File Structure

> After adding a another class our project is looking like this:
![FolderStructure](/img/folder_structure.png)

## Models

Models are used for determining the output or input of the methods.

### Adding a new Model

Add a mew json folder under the `models` folder with the model name you want. And that's it!

> Example of a model:
```json title:models/sayHelloInput.json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The person's first name."
    },
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The person's last name."
    },
    "age": {
      "description": "Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.",
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## package.json

smt smt

## rio.json

Rio json holds your projectId. 

```json title:rio.json
{
  "projectId": "*********" // your projectId visible here.
}
```
