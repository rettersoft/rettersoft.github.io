# Why Rio?
Developers used to run virtual machines in the cloud, but that was difficult to manage and scale. That's why serverless systems are preferred. Because serverless systems are scaled and managed automatically. It has its own CPU (Lambda), its own disk (s3), and its own database (dynamo db). With that, it can be thought of as a computer, but older codes are not compatible with it.

(For more about Serverless Computing: [Serverless Computing](/docs/Concepts/Serverless%20Computing/))

Instead of writing stateless functions in a serverless system, we write classes.
We don't even need a database. Each instance has a state, every data stored in its relative instance. Your objects have methods and clients can call methods. With every method call, we can just calculate the next state. Also, if one state changes, it gets synchronized to devices in real-time.

With Rio (Retter.io) we can write our logic in an object-oriented approach in a serverless system. So it is much easier and faster to write programs and maintain them. So that we can write complicated business logic in days instead of weeks or months.
