Instead of writing containerized apps you can write serverless apps for these new big super computers. \\n\\nHowever they allow you write stateless functions only.

You can call that function via Api Gateway. From your client application you can call your api via a rest api.\\n\\n\\n### Problem\\n\\nBig promise of serverless is that developers only have to write business logic. And it really helps. However they still need to deal with following issues:\\n\\n**Authentication** \u2014 Yes there are services like Cognito, but they are not really easy to use.\\n\\n**Client-Server-Communication** \u2014 Rest api\u2019s are great but they are not as easy as realtime syncing of client/server data.\\n\\n**Sorting of client requests** \u2014 Biggest problem is that somehow you need to sort requests coming from clients in object level. Think of a wallet app, transactions need to be fed into a SQS Fifo queue or maybe locked in DynamoDB row level. It becomes even more difficult if you need a request/response model and also need to sort these requests.\\nOrganization of a project in terms of source code\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nRBS solves these three major problems by implementing following:\\n\\n**Authentication** \u2014 is built into objects.\\n**Client-Server-Communication** \u2014 Objects have internal state and this state is streamed to clients in realtime.\\n**Sorting** \u2014 Any method request to an object is queued and handled in FIFO manner.\\n\\n### Example: A simple wallet\\nThe following template.yml defines two methods in a class.\\n\\n```yml\\npreAuthorizer: index.preAuthorizer\\nauthorizer: index.authorizer\\ninit: index.init\\ngetState: index.getState\\ngetInstanceId: index.getInstanceId\\nmethods:\\n    - method: addMoney\\n      tag: test\\n      sync: true\\n      steps:\\n          - id: addMoney\\n            \\n    - method: spendMoney\\n      tag: test\\n      sync: true\\n      steps:\\n          - id: spendMoney\\n            handler: index.spendMoneyHandler\\n          - id: success\\n          - id: insufficientFunds\\n            handler: index.handler\\n      flow:\\n          - direction:\\n                - spendMoney\\n                - success\\n          - id: gotoInsufficientFunds\\n            direction:\\n                - spendMoney\\n                - insufficientFunds\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis class definition template yml file creates the following diagram.\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](http://s.rtbs.io/img/1*Nz9RJzQD_s1dN7d66n6Zsw.png)\\n\\nWe have two methods we can call from our clients.

We will implement authentication related functions in this file.\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hXFJjgjd29Uz7QXuo7ShBA.png)\\n\\nNow let\u2019s start writing our lookupUser function:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport CloudObjectsOperator, { Data, StepResponse } from \'./CloudObjects\'\\n\\nconst sdk = new CloudObjectsOperator()\\n\\nexport async function lookupUser(data: Data): Promise<StepResponse> {\\n    const { success:userFound } = await sdk.getLookUpKey({ key: { name: \'email\', value: data.method.request.email } })\\n\\n    if(userFound) {\\n        data.method.response = {\\n            statusCode: 403, body: { message: \\"Email is taken\\" }\\n        }\\n        return data\\n    }\\n\\n    return data\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOur request will contain email, so we will use sdk.getLookupKey to check for another instance which might have the same email. Okay we are returning an error but let\u2019s make it more visual in our method. Implement a flow and a second step.\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*03-6XHfe6UHJQHuOZzN2DQ.png)\\n\\nWhy do we add a second step? We don\u2019t have to add it. We can do everything in one step only. But if we separate different logics into different steps we can make it more visual and anybody looking at an execution later will be able to examine what happened very quickly.\\n\\nNow add another step to create this user.\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bCig2aoebOoToF1WkXbgwA.png)\\n\\nHow do we tell the method to go to emailAlreadyTaken step? We use data.nextFlowId field. Like so:\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0PY4PPVBDHTjXnQ0fM8kdg.png)\\n\\nWe can also move some code to another function:\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*WbwvtZYqdt7n0L4uZZAESw.png)\\n\\nWe have 3 functions. Now let\u2019s see how we create a user.\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport async function createUser(data: Data): Promise<StepResponse> {\\n\\n    const { email, name, password } = data.method.request\\n\\n    await sdk.setLookUpKey({\\n        key: {\\n            name: \'email\',\\n            value: email\\n        }\\n    })\\n\\n    data.state = {\\n        ...data.state,\\n        public: { userId: data.context.instanceId },\\n        private: {\\n            email,\\n            name,\\n            password\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return data\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe first set email as a lookup value to this instance. Now let\u2019s add another step to generate a token. This token will be used by the client to sign in to rtbs.\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport async function generateToken(data: Data): Promise<StepResponse> {\\n\\n    const actionResponse = await sdk.rbsAction({\\n        name: \'rbs.core.request.GENERATE_CUSTOM_TOKEN\',\\n        data: { userId: data.method.context.userId, roleNames: [\'enduser\'] }\\n    })\\n\\n    data.method.response = {\\n        statusCode: 200,\\n        body: {\\n            customToken: actionResponse.response.customToken\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return data\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo we need to update our template.\\n\\n![rtbs screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zUUfBaVQ9jPg5CShKZZxQA.png)\\n\\nAt this point we have a working signup method.

To call this object first you need to create an RBS SDK instance.\\n\\n```typescript\\nthis.rbs = RBS.getInstance({\\n  projectId: \'{RBS_PROJECT_ID}\'\\n})\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s get an instance of our WalletB class. We also immediately start listening to its state updates.\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst co = await this.rbs?.getCloudObject({\\n  classId: \'WalletB\'\\n})\\n\\nco.state.public?.subscribe((publicState: any) => {\\n  console.log(\'publicState\', publicState)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nNow it\u2019s time to call some methods on our wallet instance\\n\\n```typescript\\nawait co.call({\\n  method: \'spendMoney\',\\n  payload: {\\n    amount: 10\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for now. We will dive deeper into cloud object mechanics in upcoming articles."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.405,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Baran Baygan","title":"Solution Architect","url":"https://github.com/baranbaygan","imageURL":"https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/262/262/1*QxTUo9SYcZQj8EomGLqOPA.jpeg","key":"baran"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Todo App with CloudObjects \u2014 Part 3/3","permalink":"/blog/todo-app-3-3"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."}]}')}}]);
